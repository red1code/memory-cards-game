# Memory Cards Game
### A browser game to test your memory capacity

This game was built with React.js, following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-memory-card) curriculum.
The main goal of this game is to apply new concepts that I have learned: using hooks to manage and utilize state while fetching and using data from an external API.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
